# ResumeXpertðŸ“ƒ
## OverviewðŸ”Ž

This project is designed to simplify the job application process by matching your pre-saved resumes to job postings and generating cold emails tailored to the job role. Built using LangChain, ChromaDB, and Streamlit, this tool helps identify the best-aligned resume and provides insights into the ATS (Applicant Tracking System) score for your profile.

## Problem StatementðŸ“œ
Applying for jobs often requires customizing resumes to align with the specific requirements of each job posting. With multiple openings having different skills and experience requirements, using a single, generic resume can reduce the chances of success. Manually tailoring resumes for each application is time-consuming, and understanding how well your profile aligns with the role can be challenging. Additionally, the lack of personalized communication, such as a tailored cold email, can hinder effective outreach to recruiters.

## FeaturesðŸ˜ª

1. Resume Matching: Matches your pre-saved resumes (with different tech stacks) to the job posting.

2. ATS Score Calculation: Calculates the percentage match between your skills and the job requirements.

3. Key Skill Identification: Extracts and highlights the essential skills required for the job.

4. Cold Email Generation: Generates a tailored cold email to introduce yourself and express interest in the role.

5. Streamlit Deployment: Provides an interactive web interface for uploading job descriptions and viewing results.
